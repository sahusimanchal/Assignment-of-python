    "Python keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings and are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python programming language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (names for variables, functions, classes, etc.) because they are reserved for specific purposes within the language.

    "- Valid Characters: Identifiers can include letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). They must start with a letter or an underscore.\n",
    "\n",

    "- No Special Characters: Identifiers cannot contain special characters such as !, @, #, $, %, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Spaces: Identifiers cannot contain spaces.\n",

    "> What are comments in Python, and why are they useful6 Provide an example\n",

    "comments are textual explanations or annotations within the code that are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution.

    "> Why is proper indentation important in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper indentation is crucial in Python because it serves as a structural element of the code, indicating blocks of code within control structures such as loops, conditionals, functions, and classes. Unlike many other programming languages where indentation is just a matter of style, in Python, it is syntactically significant. The Python interpreter uses indentation to determine the beginning and end of blocks of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why proper indentation is important in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Readability: Indentation improves code readability by visually organizing the structure of the code. It makes it easier for developers to understand the flow of control and the hierarchy of nested blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clarity: Indentation clarifies the logical structure of the code, making it clear which statements are part of a particular block of code, such as loops or conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enforces Consistency: Python's strict indentation rules enforce consistency in coding style across projects and among team members. This consistency makes the codebase more maintainable and reduces the likelihood of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. No Explicit Block Delimiters: Unlike languages such as C, Java, or JavaScript, Python does not use explicit block delimiters like curly braces {} to denote blocks of code. Instead, it relies entirely on indentation to indicate the beginning and end of blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Syntax Error Prevention: Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or alter the logic of the code unintentionally. Therefore, proper indentation helps prevent such errors and ensures that the code behaves as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Debugging: Properly indented code is easier to debug because it clearly delineates the structure of the code, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",
